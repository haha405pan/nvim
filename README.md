# The Neovim Config for Mac

Most of this configuration are copied from [David Chen](https://github.com/theniceboy/nvim) and [Christian Chiarulli](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/nvim). I configure the setting from the scratch so I can fully understand their code. I strongly recommend to give it a try and apply their brilliant work to your own workfolw. Please check this README file!
